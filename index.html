        <div class="ps">
            <p>
                Context: More often than not students find themselves in a
                awkward situation that when they arrive at the gym or the
                library only to find it too populated for them to conduct their
                activities. Students and staff need a way to find out how
                populated a certain school facility is at a given time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Problem: Rutgers is a very populated public school that
                facilities are often running at near maximum capacity. The
                current system only allows students to acquire the opening
                hours, but knowing how populated the Carr Library, or is there
                any open carrel on the second floor relies entirely on
                experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Proposed Solution: A web app that automatically acquire the
                userâ€™s location to learn how populated a place is and it should
                track the statistics for students to analyze.
            </p>
            <p>
                App vs Website: This will not be a service students use
                constantly and it would not be a feature rich environment, so
                the students might not be willing to download the app for a
                feature that they might not use too often. Ideally this should
                be a web app or a web component that is embedded into the
                Rutgers recreation and dining website.
